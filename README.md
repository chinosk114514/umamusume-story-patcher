## How to use

* Go to your umamusume folder, usually  
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\Cygames\umamusume`

`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\Cygames\umamusume\mods\umamusume-story-patcher`

## Infos

* You can take a look at the translated csv files (and the patched result in game)  
to see how the translations works  
* Hardcoded to translate only if the language is set to English for now but i'll  
add a settings tab some day  
* For any questions or suggestions DM me on discord (SkySet#3043)
